- To reproduce the experiments of our research, run main.py and find data output in the data folder.
- The data folder contains the outputted file with the simulation results of the various experiments as df_waittime.csv, 
the other files in the folder are back-ups of old simulations.
- Producing the figures from the paper can be done by running visualisation.ipynb,
it will output the figures that are visible in the figures folder.
